The following CSS rule applies a background color to a div element, but it doesn't work as expected: #myDiv { background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); }  The problem is that the div element has an inline style applied to it that sets its background color to a different value, such as  style="background-color: blue;". The inline style has a higher priority than the external CSS rule, thus overriding it.
