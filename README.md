This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue where inline styles override external stylesheets. The bug.css file contains a CSS rule to set the background color of a div element. However, an inline style in the HTML overwrites this rule. The solution.css file demonstrates how to resolve this issue using more specific CSS selectors or !important declaration.  This is a good example of understanding CSS specificity and cascading order.
